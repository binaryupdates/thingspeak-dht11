# ThingSpeak with DHT11 Module
In this example project, we'll connect DHT11 Module to <b> GPIO21 Pin of Raspberry Pi4.</b> 
<p>Later on, we'll send temperature and humidity data to ThingSpeak IoT Platform. This is a simple weather monitoring system to demonstrate how RPi4 can send data to ThingSpeak using HTTP Protocol</p>
